# Dyslexia Detection
## Running the webapp

The app is developed in Python with frontend Developed in streamlit. To run the app in a vertual environment install the packages in ```requirements.txt``` using the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the app using

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Folder structure:

### data:
contains the datasets used for Machine learning. The handwriting samples of the dyslexic childern are in ```dyslexic``` directory and the non-dyslexic samples are in ```non_dyslexic``` directory. 

The ```data.csv``` has the extracted features of all the images in the above directories. the features are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Spelling accuracy</li>
<li>Gramatical accuracy</li> 
<li>Percentage of corrections</li>
<li>Phonetic accuraccy (%)</li>
<li>Presence of dyslexia</li>
</ul>


the ```school_symptoms.txt``` has the symptoms of the disorder documented.

### images:
This folder contains the output images from visualization of the extracted features from the images which explains the accuracy of the classifier on the data.

### model_training:
This folder contains the training and evaluation of various machine learning models on the extracted data.

### app.py:
this file is the main file of the web application. This file has the logic for extracting all the required features from the uploaded image and making a predicton using the pretrained decision tree model.
